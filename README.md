# R-demo

A crash course demo for the R programming language.

## Getting started

First you need to install the [latest version of R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/). Next you need an IDE to work in. I recommend [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) because it has a lot of useful features for working with R. Once you have both of those installed, go ahead and start up RStudio.

Next, clone this repo to your machine and open the `R-demo.R` file in RStudio.

## Basics

- [Quick-R](https://www.statmethods.net/index.html)
  - A good quick reference for learning R.
- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
  - This is an excellent resource for getting used to using R for different tasks. For some reason the page won't open on the Watco VPN though.
- [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
  - There's a collection of packages called the `Tidyverse` that are used to facilitate [Tidy data](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html). They are a good place to learn all the things R can be used for and what good coding practice means in R.

## Data Visualization

- [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
  - A well-known visualization package based on [The Grammar of Graphics](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~wilkinson/TheGrammarOfGraphics/GOG.html).
- [Leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/)
  - A nice visualization package for displaying location and geospatial data.
- [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)
  - A very powerful framework for developing dashboards in R. See [ShinyDashboard](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/) for an easy-to-use dashboard template.

## Data Transformation

- [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)
  - The most popular data transformation package in R.
- [tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/)
  - A little more technical than `dplyr`, but very useful.
- [purrr](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/)
  - Enhances R's functional programming base. I haven't used this one as much as the others, but have heard good things about it.
