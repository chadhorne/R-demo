# R-demo

A crash course demo for the R programming language.

## Getting started

First you need to install the [latest version of R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/). Next you need an IDE to work in. I recommend [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) because it has a lot of useful features for working with R. Once you have both of those installed, go ahead and start up RStudio.

Next, clone this repo to your machine and open the `R-demo.R` file in RStudio.
